# Instructions for setting up and using the application

# 1. Install Python 3.7 or higher
# 2. Ensure FFmpeg is installed and available in your system's PATH. 
#    You can check by running: ffmpeg -version

#    FFmpeg Installation:
#    - Windows: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
#    - Mac: brew install ffmpeg
#    - Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg

# 3. Install the required dependencies by running:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt

speechrecognition
pydub
openai-whisper
torchaudio
numpy
ffmpeg-python 
scipy 

# After installing the dependencies, follow these steps to use the application:

# 1. Place your MP3 file(s) in the 'testFiles' folder. There is a
#    Example: <project_root>/testFiles/your_audio_file.mp3

# 2. Run the script by passing the path to the MP3 file as an argument:
#    python main.py ../testFiles/your_audio_file.mp3
#    NOTE: Get into the src directory before running this command.

# 3. The script will:
#    - Convert the MP3 file to WAV format (saved in the 'wavs' folder, which will be created if not present).
#    - Transcribe the audio and save the text in the 'outputs' folder (also will be created if not present) as 'transcription.txt'.
#    NOTE: This program will check for duplicates. Outputs of mp3 files, if already present, will not be recreated. 
#
#    Example: The transcription will be saved as:
#    <project_root>/outputs/transcription.txt

# 4. Ensure the directory structure follows this format:
#    <project_root>
#    ├── outputs/         # Transcribed text files will be saved here
#    ├── testFiles/       # Place your MP3 files here
#    ├── wavs/            # Converted WAV files will be saved here
#    ├── src/             # Contains the main.py script
#    └── requirements.txt # This file
